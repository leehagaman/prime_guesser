The idea is to build a language model to guess prime numbers. I'm curious what types of patterns it will learn: growing over time, no even numbers, twin primes, etc. Plus it should be a good learning experience!

Currently a work in progress, very incomplete.

Using parts of Andrez Karpathy's [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) as a reference.

Requires [primesieve](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve) to be available from the command line to quickly generate training and testing data.
